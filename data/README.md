# Data

This folder is adept to store all data used in the pre-processing, the training, and the post-processing phases.
Specifically, we store:
- model_state: stores data to instantiate a new model from the best validation state of the current training run.
- raw_data: stores the training data.
- submission_data: stores the list of submission ids and the current submission file.
